→ Demonstrates: Real-time data access, fleet aggregation, multi-location awareness

**"Which robots need attention right now?"**  
→ Demonstrates: Proactive monitoring, priority identification, battery alerts

**"What's our fleet performance today?"**  
→ Demonstrates: KPI synthesis, operational metrics, success rate tracking

---

## Robot-Specific Diagnostics

**"Run diagnostics on SERVI-001"** (or any robot ID)  
→ Demonstrates: Tool calling, individual robot analysis, actual mock data retrieval

**"What's the battery level of SERVI-003?"**  
→ Demonstrates: Specific data queries, real-time status checks

**"Show me robots with errors"**  
→ Demonstrates: Error detection, filtering logic, proactive alerting

---

## Operational Intelligence

**"Which facility has the most active robots?"**  
→ Demonstrates: Multi-facility analysis, comparative insights

**"What incidents happened today?"**  
→ Demonstrates: Event tracking, historical data access, incident management

**"Compare Servi Plus and Carti 100 performance"**  
→ Demonstrates: Model comparison, analytics reasoning

---

## Data Exploration

**"Show me trip statistics across the fleet"**  
→ Demonstrates: Aggregated metrics, cross-robot analysis

**"What's the average distance traveled today?"**  
→ Demonstrates: Mathematical aggregation, fleet-wide calculations

**"Which robots are currently charging?"**  
→ Demonstrates: State-based filtering, real-time status queries

---

## Multi-Agent Coordination (Conceptual)

**"How would Ursa Major handle a coordinated delivery?"**  
→ Demonstrates: Multi-agent architecture understanding, orchestration concepts

**"What does Grizzly Bear know about robot maintenance?"**  
→ Demonstrates: Knowledge base integration, domain expertise routing

## Tips for Best Results

✅ **Use specific robot IDs** (SERVI-001, SERVI-003, CARTI-001, etc.)  
✅ **Ask for "current" or "real-time" data** to show live integration  
✅ **Request diagnostics** to showcase tool calling  
✅ **Compare facilities** (Sunnyvale, San Francisco, etc.) for multi-location insights  
✅ **Ask follow-up questions** to show conversation continuity  

❌ **Avoid asking about features not built yet** (predictive maintenance, advanced ML)  
❌ **Don't expect exact future predictions** (AI provides insights, not guarantees)  
❌ **Remember: data is mock** but architecture and patterns are real

## Quick Demo Flow (2-3 minutes)

1. **Start broad**: "Show me fleet status"
2. **Go specific**: "Run diagnostics on SERVI-001"
3. **Show intelligence**: "Which robots need attention?"
4. **Demonstrate continuity**: "What about SERVI-003?"

This flow shows: data access → tool calling → proactive insights → conversation memory
